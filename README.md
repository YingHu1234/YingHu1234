### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒ± Welcome to visit!

ðŸŒž Hello, I am Tiffany, a Jan 2021 Business Analytics Master's Graduate from California State University East Bay.

I am an Analyst with three years of experience in the accounting industry. During my time working in the accounts payable team, I dealt with massive transaction data from thousands of business vendors. The technology stack that I used on a day to day basis involved SQL and Python. We also used various data processing tools, including Microsoft Suites, Excel, Word, etc.)

Despite developing strong problem-solving skills from my work experience, I want to provide better suggestions to my threshold based on research outcomes. Thus, I decided to go back to school for a master's degree in Business Analytics to consolidate my business sense.

Currently, I am actively searching for a Full-Time Data Analytics / Data Science position.
Thank you for your time!
